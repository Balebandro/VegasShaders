// 2026-11-04 local exposure ([Shaders.LocalExposure], off by default): each part of the picture exposed for its own brightness,
// as the eye and Unreal Engine 5's Local Exposure do -- the shade under a desert rock no longer goes black next to sunlit sand,
// a doorway seen from a dark room no longer burns white. Three small passes before the tone mapper measure each neighbourhood's
// log brightness at 1/16 resolution and blur it (Effects\LocalExposure.fx.hlsl); the tone mapper (both ISHDRBLENDINSHADERCIN
// shaders, Includes/Tonemapping.hlsl localExposure) then lifts dark neighbourhoods and calms bright ones toward a mid grey, less
// at edges (no halos). README.md in this folder.
