// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-01 why each effect did what it did, per frame (core/Diagnostics.cpp; docs/UNOFFICIAL-TECHNICAL.md "Diagnostics").
// A small registry the effects report into with one-line calls where they already decide; nothing is restructured. Kept in memory
// only (a 16-frame ring per effect, a few bytes each) and written to the log in three places:
//   - a FLASH dump (the flash detector) and a REPORT block (the report key): every effect's state that frame, what changed from the
//     frame before, the shader levels / fallbacks that are not the default, the shader cache and D3D failure counts;
//   - the 60 s HEARTBEAT: per effect how many frames it drew and skipped in the minute (and the last skip reason).
// Calls:
//   - EffectRecord::Render notes every effect it is called for (drawn, or skipped: off / not loaded / ShouldRender false), so every
//     effect is covered at that level; an effect whose Render override returns early notes its own reason (EFFECT_STATUS).
//   - EFFECT_HISTORY(name, "kept" / "reset: why") where an effect decides whether to reuse last frame's history;
//     SessionLog::HistoryReset notes it too.
//   - Level(what, chosen, isDefault): a shader level or a fallback chosen at load or later (FIT levels, X4505 retries, FSR / DLSS
//     failures). Only the non-default ones are printed.
//   - ShaderLoaded / D3DFail / TargetSize: the shader cache counters, a failed D3D / NVR DXVK call (count + first frame per site),
//     a render target made at another size than before.
// The strings passed must live for the session (literals, effect names): only their pointers are kept.
