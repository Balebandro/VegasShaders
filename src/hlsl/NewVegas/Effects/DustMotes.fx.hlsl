// UNOFFICIAL 2026-11-03: dust motes -- sparse tiny specks of dust in the air, seen only where light falls on them (near lamps, in
// the sun's shafts), glinting towards the light. Procedural, so it works in every cell (src\effects\DustMotes\README.md).
//
// The specks live in a 3D grid of cells (CellSize game units, 40 = 57 cm) that drifts slowly with the air. A cell holds one speck
// or none (a hash of the cell's number against Density); the speck sits at a hashed spot inside the cell, kept away from its faces,
// and wobbles round it. The grid's pattern repeats every 64 cells (the hash is of the cell number modulo 64), far beyond the few
// metres drawn, and the C++ side hands over the camera's place in it already wrapped, so every position here is small.
//   0 Specks  (half resolution, into TESR_DustMotesBuffer): each pixel's view, from NearStart out to the first surface or MaxDistance,
//             is cut to the stretch that some lamp's reach covers (all of it when the sun counts); the cells that stretch crosses are
//             visited one by one (3D DDA). Each speck's light on the pixel is a soft disc round the view: never narrower than about
//             a pixel (sub-pixel specks are drawn that wide but dimmer, so they keep their light and do not flicker as they move),
//             never wider than about two. The strongest speck is lit: every lamp's light with a smooth falloff to nothing at its
//             radius, the sun's where the volumetric light's froxel grid says the air is lit, each through a forward-scattering
//             phase (bright between you and the light), with a slow per-speck twinkle. The result is written as what it adds to the
//             gamma-encoded HDR frame at this spot (the light added in linear light), so the next pass needs no frame read.
//   1 Composite (full resolution, additive blending into the frame chain's current image): the buffer read bilinearly, pixels
//             with no speck discarded, so only the specks' pixels are written. Alpha is left as it is.
//
// Known gaps: the lamps' shadows are not read (a speck in a lamp's reach is lit even behind a wall: the reach is short and the
// depth test hides specks behind surfaces, so this shows only as a few specks in a lamp's shaded corner), and indoors the sun does
// not light the specks (the froxel grid is an exterior pass).
